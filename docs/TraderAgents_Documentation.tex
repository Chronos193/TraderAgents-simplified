\section{Introduction}

TraderAgents-Simplified represents a cutting-edge approach to algorithmic trading that combines artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and financial analysis. Unlike traditional trading systems that rely solely on quantitative models, our system incorporates natural language processing and reasoning capabilities through Large Language Models (LLMs) to make more nuanced and contextual trading decisions.

The system is designed as a simplified yet comprehensive implementation of multi-agent trading systems, making it accessible for research, education, and development purposes while maintaining the sophisticated decision-making capabilities expected in modern financial technology.

\subsection{Motivation}

Traditional algorithmic trading systems often struggle with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Processing unstructured data such as news and social media sentiment
    \item Incorporating qualitative analysis alongside quantitative metrics
    \item Adapting to rapidly changing market conditions
    \item Providing explainable and transparent decision-making processes
\end{itemize}

TraderAgents-Simplified addresses these challenges by implementing a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to analyze different aspects of market data and engage in structured debates to reach consensus on trading decisions.

\subsection{Key Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Modal Analysis}: Integration of technical, fundamental, news, and sentiment analysis
    \item \textbf{Debate-Driven Decision Making}: Implementation of adversarial reasoning through bullish and bearish research agents
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Risk Management}: Multi-perspective risk assessment with specialized risk debater agents
    \item \textbf{Modular Architecture}: Easily extensible system design with clear separation of concerns
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Integration}: Live data processing with external financial APIs
\end{enumerate}

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Overview}

The TraderAgents-Simplified system follows a pipeline architecture consisting of four main stages, each implemented as a team of specialized AI agents. The system uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration and state management, ensuring reliable execution and data flow between agents.

        \draw[thick,->] (9.5,3) -- (9.5,2.5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Multi-Agent System Architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Agent Teams}

\subsubsection{Analyst Team}
The analyst team consists of four specialized agents responsible for different aspects of financial analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fundamentals Analyst}: Processes company financial statements, calculates key ratios, and evaluates business metrics using yfinance data
    \item \textbf{Technical Analyst}: Performs technical analysis including MACD, RSI calculations, and trend analysis
    \item \textbf{News Analyst}: Aggregates and analyzes recent news headlines using Finnhub API with fallback to yfinance
    \item \textbf{Sentiment Analyst}: Evaluates market sentiment through news analysis and social media indicators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Research Team}
The research team implements adversarial reasoning through structured debates:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bullish Researcher}: Constructs positive investment thesis based on analyst findings
    \item \textbf{Bearish Researcher}: Develops contrarian perspective highlighting potential risks and downsides
    \item \textbf{Debate Coordinator}: Orchestrates structured debates between bullish and bearish perspectives, determining consensus
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Trading Agent}
A single agent responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Converting research debate outcomes into actionable trade proposals
    \item Calculating position sizes based on portfolio constraints
    \item Fetching real-time pricing data
    \item Estimating trade costs and portfolio impact
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Risk Management Team}
The most sophisticated team consisting of five agents:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk Summarizer}: Consolidates all previous analysis into comprehensive risk assessment
    \item \textbf{Aggressive Debater}: Advocates for higher-risk, higher-reward positions
    \item \textbf{Conservative Debater}: Promotes risk-averse approaches and capital preservation
    \item \textbf{Neutral Debater}: Provides balanced perspective and mediates between extremes
    \item \textbf{Risk Coordinator}: Makes final risk-adjusted recommendations based on all perspectives
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Technology Stack}

The system is built using modern Python technologies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python 3.12+}: Core programming language
    \item \textbf{LangChain 0.3}: LLM orchestration and prompt management
    \item \textbf{LangGraph}: State-based workflow management
    \item \textbf{Groq Llama3-8B}: Primary language model for reasoning
    \item \textbf{Pydantic}: Data validation and schema definition
    \item \textbf{Poetry}: Dependency management and packaging
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Integration}

The system integrates multiple data sources for comprehensive market analysis:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption=Data Source Integration Example]
# Yahoo Finance for price and fundamental data
stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
price = stock.info.get("regularMarketPrice")

# Finnhub for news and market data
url = f"https://finnhub.io/api/v1/company-news?symbol={ticker}"
resp = requests.get(url, timeout=30)

# Technical indicators calculation
def _calculate_macd(self, close_prices, fast=12, slow=26, signal=9):
    exp1 = close_prices.ewm(span=fast).mean()
    exp2 = close_prices.ewm(span=slow).mean()
    macd = exp1 - exp2
    signal_line = macd.ewm(span=signal).mean()
    return macd.iloc[-1], signal_line.iloc[-1]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Agent Communication}

Agents communicate through a shared state dictionary managed by LangGraph, ensuring data consistency and proper workflow execution:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption=State Management Example]
class TradingState(TypedDict):
    # Required fields
    ticker: str
    
    # Optional intermediate outputs
    fundamentals_analysis: Optional[FundamentalsAnalysisOutput]
